# Gym Review API

Group Assignment 3: Building and securing a tested REST API.

This project is a small full-stack Gym Review application with a tested REST API, Auth0 authentication, protected routes, and a React frontend.

## Setup

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ViktorOlausson/AssignmentTestsAndSecureAPI.git
cd AssignmentTestsAndSecureAPI
```

### Install dependencies

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Install client dependencies:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

Create a backend `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```

The backend needs these values:

```env
PORT=3000
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

AUTH0_SECRET=replace_me
AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=replace_me
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.eu.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=replace_me_optional
```

Do not commit real `.env` values or Auth0 secrets.

### Auth0 application settings

In the Auth0 dashboard, configure the application with:

```text
Allowed Callback URLs:
http://localhost:3000/callback, http://localhost:5173/callback, http://localhost:5173/login

Allowed Logout URLs:
http://localhost:5173/login

Allowed Web Origins:
http://localhost:5173/login

Allowed Origins(CORS):
http://localhost:5173, http://localhost:5173/login


```

### Database setup

Run Prisma migration and seed data:

```bash
cd backend
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed
```

### Run locally

Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

## API Routes

| Method | Route               | Access    |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------- |
| GET    | `/gyms`             | Public    |
| GET    | `/gyms/:id`         | Public    |
| POST   | `/gyms`             | Protected |
| POST   | `/gyms/:id/reviews` | Protected |
| GET    | `/profile`          | Protected |

Protected routes require an authenticated Auth0 session.

## Testing

Run backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

The project uses Vitest for both unit and integration tests.

Tests use a separate SQLite database file:

```text
backend/test.db
```

This keeps local development data in `backend/dev.db` from being reset when tests run.

Unit tests cover UI and utility logic in isolation without real network calls.

Integration tests cover the API using `node:http`, including:

- `GET /gyms`
- `GET /gyms/:id`
- `GET /gyms/:id` returning `404`
- `POST /gyms` returning `401` when logged out
- `POST /gyms/:id/reviews` returning `401` when logged out

## Authentication

This project uses **Auth0** with `express-openid-connect`.

Auth0 was chosen because the assignment allows Auth0 session-based authentication, and it fits the backend/frontend setup well. The backend manages the login, callback, session cookie, and logout flow. The frontend redirects users to backend login/logout routes.

Authentication is implemented in the backend with:

- `authMiddleware`
- `requiresAuth()`
- `errorOnRequiredAuth: true`

The protected API routes use `requiresAuth()`:

- `POST /gyms`
- `POST /gyms/:id/reviews`
- `GET /profile`

Unauthenticated users receive `401 Unauthorized` instead of being redirected.

The frontend checks login state by calling:

```text
GET /profile
```

with:

```ts
credentials: "include";
```

Protected frontend routes and menu items are only shown when the user is logged in.

## Security Decisions

### No secrets in the repository

Real Auth0 secrets and local environment values are kept in `.env`, which is ignored by Git. The repository includes `.env.example` to document required variables without exposing secrets.

### Sensitive values are listed in `.env.example`

The backend `.env.example` documents the required Auth0, database, and frontend origin settings so the project can be configured safely on another machine.

### Protected routes return 401

The backend uses `errorOnRequiredAuth: true`, so protected routes return `401 Unauthorized` when a user is not logged in. This is verified by integration tests.

### CORS is restricted

CORS is configured to allow only the frontend origin:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

The API does not use a wildcard `*`, because authenticated requests use cookies and should only be allowed from the known frontend.

### Tokens are not stored in localStorage

The frontend does not store tokens in `localStorage`. Auth0 session handling is managed through secure session cookies by the backend middleware. This reduces the risk of token theft through client-side JavaScript.

### Authenticated requests use credentials

Frontend requests that need the logged-in session use:

```ts
credentials: "include";
```

This allows the browser to send the Auth0 session cookie to the backend.

## Frontend

The React frontend includes:

- Login page
- Profile dashboard
- Public gyms page
- Protected add gym page
- Protected add review page
- Login/logout navigation
- Menu items that change based on login state
- Loading and error states

Public users can view gyms and reviews.

Logged-in users can create gyms and reviews.

## Reflections

### Implementation choices

We chose a `backend/` and `client/` folder structure to keep API and frontend code separated. The backend uses Express and Prisma with SQLite because the assignment focuses more on testing and authentication than database complexity.

The frontend uses React with Vite and TypeScript. The protected pages are guarded on the client for user experience, while the backend still enforces real security with `requiresAuth()`.

### Testing choices

Vitest is used for both unit and integration tests so the test setup stays simple and consistent. Unit tests cover isolated UI logic. Integration tests start the Express app with `node:http` and test real API behavior.

### Security choices

Auth0 session-based authentication keeps tokens out of browser storage. Protected API routes are enforced on the backend, not only hidden in the frontend. CORS is restricted to the frontend origin so authenticated cookie requests are not accepted from arbitrary origins.

### Challenges

The most challenging parts were connecting Auth0 correctly with a separate React frontend and backend API, especially callback and logout URLs. Another challenge was making TypeScript, ESM, Prisma, and the test runner work together cleanly.

### What I would improve

With more time, we would add more authenticated success-case tests, improve form validation, add better test database isolation, and include a richer GitHub Actions test summary.
